### Create A Branch

Before you start working, you will need to create a separate branch specific to the issue / feature you're working on. You will push your work to this branch.

#### Naming Your Branch

Name the branch something like `fix/xxx` or `feature/xxx` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are attempting to add. For example `fix/email-login` would be a branch where you fix something specific to email login.

#### Adding Your Branch

To create a branch on your local machine (and switch to this branch):

```shell
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

Check you are in the correct branch:

```shell
$ git branch
```
(It should show all the branches and the one with the star is the one you are on)

Open the current directory in your faviorite text editor:

```shell
$ atom .
```
Make your changes and save the files.

Then add your changed files to staging:

```shell
$ git add .
```

Then commit your changes:

```shell
$ git commit -m "Leave a comment about the change"
```
and then push your branch to GitHub:

```shell
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```
